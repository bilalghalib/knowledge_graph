These three pairs of terms represent key concepts in the context, along with their relationships. The first pair highlights the different ways to categorize responses to modernity. The second pair shows how liberal/literal Islam is contrasted with reformist/conservative approaches. The third pair illustrates the division between traditionalists who reject modernity and reformers who question its underpinnings.

Note that some of these relationships are not explicitly stated in the text, but can be inferred based on the context. For example, the relationship between "Wahhabis" and "fundamentalists" is stated as "termed as", implying a label or categorization. Similarly, the relationship between "traditionalists" and "salafism" is inferred to be similar in nature to the comparison made between Catholic figures Padre Pio and Mother Teresa.

I extracted the following key terms:

* Afghani
* 'Abduh
* Hasan al-Banna
* Muslim Brotherhood
* Portes
* modernity
* tradition

And their relations are:

* Afghani and 'Abduh have an intellectual lineage.
* Hasan al-Banna is the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, which inherits the intellectual legacy of Afghani and 'Abduh.
* Portes has a closer familiarity with modernity.
* Tradition and modernity lack symmetry and presence of inaccuracy.

Let me know if this meets your expectations!

Based on the given context, I extracted the following ontology of terms:

1. **Islamic totalism**: A concept that refers to a tendency to view Islam as a total way of life with guidance for political, economic, and social behavior.
2. **Modernity**: A concept that refers to a tendency to embrace modern offerings of material technology, social organisation, political arrangement, progress, change, and the remaining ideals of modernity.

The following is the list of json elements representing the relations between these terms:

[
   {
       "node_1": "Islamic totalism",
       "node_2": "modernity",
       "edge": "These two concepts are presented as the axes of a two-dimensional spectrum, with Islamic totalism referring to a tendency to view Islam as a total way of life and modernity referring to a tendency to embrace modern offerings."
   }

Note that there is only one relation between these terms mentioned in the context, which is their presentation as the axes of a two-dimensional spectrum.

Note that I have extracted terms such as people (Al-Mashhūr), organizations (KSA), dates, places (introduction), and concepts (autobiographical works, writer) and their relations based on the context. The output is in the format of a list of JSON objects, where each object represents a pair of terms and their relation.

Since the context is a single number ("146"), I will extract terms and their relations as follows:

* Term: "146" (a numerical value)
* Relation: It is likely an identifier or a reference number.

The ontology consists of terms such as `Al-Mashhūr`, `materialism`, `conservativism`, `engagement with modernity`, `acknowledgment of limitations`, `loss of authority`, `contemporary world`, `epistemic decolonisation`, and `presupposition that the present state of affairs is superior or irreversible`. The relations between these terms capture their connections, such as Al-Mashhūr's confrontation with materialism, how a closed environment impacted conservativism, and how epistemic decolonisation requires overcoming certain presuppositions.

]

Let me explain my thought process:

Thought 1: I identified key terms in the context such as Quadri, colonial Egypt, Hallaq, philosopher, post-colonial Muslim responses, geographical focus, and Muslim world.

Thought 2: I looked at how these terms are related to each other. For example, Quadri's work is about a traditional jurist's response to modernity in colonial Egypt. This suggests that Quadri's work is related to the concept of colonial Egypt and modernity. Similarly, Hallaq's work traces an unfinished response of a philosopher, which implies a connection between Hallaq and the concept of philosopher.

Thought 3: I then looked at the relations between each pair of terms. For example, the edge "investigates" connects Quadri to the concept of case study. The edge "response to" connects colonial Egypt to modernity. And so on.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!

Based on the given context, I extract the following ontology of terms:

* Terms:
	+ Networks
	+ Numbers
	+ Political Modernity Codes

These terms represent key concepts in the context.

Now, let's think about how these terms can have one-on-one relations with other terms. Since they are mentioned together in the same sentence, it seems that there is a relationship between "Networks" and "Numbers", possibly indicating that numbers are used to analyze or describe networks.

Similarly, "Political Modernity Codes" seems to be related to "Networks" as it might refer to a specific framework or classification system for analyzing political networks.

Here's the output in JSON format:

[
    {
        "node_1": "Networks",
        "node_2": "Numbers",

        "node_2": "Political Modernity Codes",
        "edge": "Related framework or classification system"
    }
]

Note that these relationships are based on my interpretation of the context and may not be exact representations of actual connections between concepts.

Based on the given context, I have extracted the ontology of terms mentioned in it. These terms represent key concepts as per the context.

Here's my thought process:

Thought 1: While traversing through each sentence, I think about the key terms mentioned in it.
Terms may include object, entity, location, organization, person, condition, acronym, documents, service, concept, etc.
Terms should be as atomistic as possible

Thought 2: Think about how these terms can have one on one relation with other terms.
Terms that are mentioned in the same sentence or the same paragraph are typically related to each other.
Terms can be related to many other terms

Thought 3: Find out the relation between each such related pair of terms.

Here's my output as a list of JSON:
