      "of Wellbeing * Journal of Social Entrepreneurship * International Journal of Entrepreneurial Behavior & Research * Journal of Business Venturing Insights I'm happy to further discuss and refine the focus and framing for the paper. This research has the potential to make a meaningful contribution to how we develop and support resilient, impactful entrepreneurs in challenging times and places. Let me know if you have any other questions! CopyRetry BG that sounds a bit ambitious for one paper - ask me 3 questions to determine an appropriate subset and come up with 15 different potential titles for my paper based on my answers and the content you have above Edit Absolutely, let's narrow the focus to create a more targeted paper. Here are three questions to help determine the most compelling and impactful subset of your research: 1. Which finding or insight from your research do you feel has the most immediate practical application for entrepreneurship education and support programs? 2. Is there a particular aspect of your research that has been less explored in the existing literature and could make a novel contribution to the field? 3. Considering the current global context and challenges, what message or theme from your work feels most urgent and relevant to share with educators, entrepreneurs, and support organizations? CopyRetry BG 1. i think that it's possible to create checkins that promotes deliberate rumination and social cohesion/connection and support that checks a lot\n"
